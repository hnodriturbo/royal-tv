## 22 sept 2025 - Monday
- ⚡ Started step 2 by creating publicMessageEvents.js & publicRoomEvents
- ⚙️ Fixed index.js (added pickValue helper so all guests get guest role and guest-id using the socket.id)
- 🕗 I am working to finish coding the event files.  

- **📚 Spent 4 hours today on the computer working.**
- It takes a long time figuring out how to keep this system specially away from the main liveChat system.
- A long time went into learning where to start and how to organize the event files making sure all fits.
- Spent time working on reading all other codes related to the socket system.
- Decided to add extra file later that handles connecting the client with cookies to socket.io so a conversation can be persisted between pages and even login and logout.
